Built between the late 16th century and 1621 by order of Luis López de Haro, Marquis of Carpio, with permission from Philip II, this castle guarded the coast from pirate raids. Its sturdy masonry features three cylindrical towers and a larger southern tower crowned with a defensive machicolation and the Carpio coat of arms above the main gate. It marked the birth of Carboneras’ urban core: land was granted to soldiers to encourage settlement. Inside stood homes, stores, stables and a chapel dedicated to Saint Andrew. Declared a Site of Cultural Interest (BIC) in 1993, it has been restored and now hosts cultural events and the tourist office.
