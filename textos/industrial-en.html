Beyond Las Martinicas Beach lies Carboneras’ industrial zone, packing a wide array of activities into a compact area—a striking counterpoint to the natural park ahead. Notable here is Endesa’s former thermal power plant, shut down years ago and now being dismantled. The Carboneras desalination plant—among the largest in Europe—has eased the burden of drought in this arid region, where rainfall is among the lowest in Western Europe; its water supports both households and irrigation across Campo de Níjar and the Levante Almeriense/Bajo Almanzora municipalities.
