Ranked among Spain’s most beautiful beaches, it belongs to Carboneras and lies within the Cabo de Gata‑Níjar Natural Park. Its crystal‑clear turquoise waters and pristine setting are framed by cliffs and volcanic formations. Getting there: from Carboneras, drive toward Agua Amarga and park near the viewpoint and tourist info point. From there, a 20‑minute footpath leads down to the beach. Why the name “of the Dead”? It recalls a 1869 storm that trapped fishermen beneath Mesa Roldán; five perished despite rescue efforts, and later shipwrecks cemented the somber toponym.
