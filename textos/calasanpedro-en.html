A near‑secret nook of the Natural Park, famed for its wild feel. Crystal waters, pale sand and a rocky seabed lie beside the 16th‑century San Pedro Tower, raised to guard the coast from pirates. With no roads or urban sprawl, it keeps a singular charm—perfect to unplug, snorkel and while away a peaceful beach day. Getting there: from Las Negras, a coastal trail of ~4 km (≈1 h) with some climbs; bring good shoes and water. Did you know? Since the 1980s, a small self‑sufficient community lives here, off‑grid and supplied by a spring.
