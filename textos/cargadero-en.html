The remains of the mineral loading dock recall a not‑too‑distant chapter in Almería’s past: its mining heyday. To find the old pier, look for the offshore rock that supported it. The structure was 70 m long and stood 14 m above sea level. It marked the terminus of the railway from Lucainena de las Torres to Agua Amarga, chosen here for shelter from easterly winds. Iron from Sierra Alhamilla shipped out from this point. The line began service in 1896, and in 1942—after intermittent activity—the last steamer sailed from the pier. Once the veins were exhausted, the facilities were dismantled and the metal taken to Almería for smelting.
