Tucked away and sheltered, it stands out for glass‑clear waters and a volcanic setting. The demanding access has kept it pristine—a haven for quiet and unspoiled nature. Excellent for snorkeling in lively, transparent waters. Surrounding formations and cliffs are a treat for hikers and photographers. Getting there: from Agua Amarga, follow the coastal trail toward Cala del Plomo and continue ~1 km (≈1 h 15 min). From Cala del Plomo, a signed 20‑minute walk over volcanic rock leads to this hidden gem.
