On a headland between Punta de los Muertos and Punta de Media Naranja, beside the lighthouse, this watchtower commands the horizon over 220 m above the sea. Built in 1766 upon earlier Muslim and Nasrid structures, its unusual “hoof-shaped” plan makes it unique. A lookout already stood here in the Middle Ages against Viking and Berber raids. During the Reconquista the Crown strengthened these defenses, making Mesa Roldán one of the most strategic (and perilous) points along the Almerían coast; guards received hazard pay. Geologically, it’s an ancient submarine volcanic dome topped by a six‑million‑year‑old fossil coral reef, giving it a flat summit. The tower today is heavily deteriorated. Access: walk a few meters uphill from the lighthouse. Fun fact: Game of Thrones filmed scenes here for its dramatic landscape and atmosphere.
