Perched 220 m above sea level on an ancient volcanic rise, Mesa Roldán Lighthouse offers one of the most breathtaking views in Cabo de Gata‑Níjar Natural Park. Just 7 km from Carboneras and 4 km from Agua Amarga, it was inaugurated in 1863 and has guided sailors for over 160 years. Its light, visible up to 23 nautical miles, marked a turning point in local maritime safety, where previously only bonfires blazed from the old watchtower. Getting there: from Playa de los Muertos parking, take the paved road to the summit (well signposted, with a few sharp bends). Fun fact: in 1934, snowfall iced over its windowpanes—an exceedingly rare sight here.
