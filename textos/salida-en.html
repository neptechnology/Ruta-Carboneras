Opened in 1991 by the King and Queen of Spain, the fishing port of Carboneras is among the most active on the Mediterranean coast. Here you can soak up maritime life up close: longliners, trawlers and purse seiners; nets drying in the sun; and fishermen’s huts that still retain their traditional charm. Carboneras’ longline fleet, specializing in bluefin tuna and swordfish, is one of the most prominent in the Mediterranean. The fish market hosts a daily afternoon auction of freshly landed catch, later featured across town restaurants. Don’t leave without tasting Carboneras’ red prawn, caught in deep local waters—celebrated for its intense flavor and succulent texture.
