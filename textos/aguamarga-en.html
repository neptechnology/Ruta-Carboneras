Leaving Carboneras, we enter the municipality of NÃ­jar and the hamlet of Agua Amarga. Fishing, mining and now tourism have shaped its identity. Aligned with the beach lies the former fishing quarter, with low, whitewashed houses. Beyond it are two emblematic coves of the Natural Park: Enmedio and del Plomo. The white cliffs of reef limestone stand out in the scenery.
