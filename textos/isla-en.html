Just 400 meters off the Carboneras coastline rises San Andrés Island, a volcanic formation of around 15,000 m<sup>2</sup> declared a Natural Monument for its ecological significance. It’s an emblematic spot and a beacon for sea lovers. Beneath the surface lies an underwater paradise: rocky beds with fissures, caves and seagrass meadows hosting groupers, combers, damselfish, wrasses, green wrasse, black and white seabream, two-banded seabream, barracudas, and even croakers and ocean sunfish in spring. Book a kayak tour to circle the island without landing, or dive the rocky bottoms to get closer to its marine life.
